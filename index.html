      <p>We all know Koalas are cute, but did you know they spend most of their time eating, sleeping, and contracting chlamydia? They are very lazy animals and the chlamydia epidemic among Koalas is so bad that the disease has become drug resistant. This threatens the species as a whole. Personally, I feel bad for the poor fuzzy little beasts...They had no idea they were making such bad choices.</p>
